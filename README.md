# Etta-Project
For this project I implemented a blogging tool using dockers. I used the images of sql wordpress and nginx. Some extra facilities this site has are: it keeps its data even after reboot. The containers restart automaticly after reboot, all flow is directed trough nginx, so that the containers do not have access to one another
